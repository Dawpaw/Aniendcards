# Aniendcards

Website to display Anime Endcards

I like anime endcards.    
I don't know about a website were I can easily find anime endcards, navigate through animes and artist and get it all.
So I just did it myself.   


### Details:
- Backend runs using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
- Frontend runs using Svelte

### Running:
- In the backend: start FasAPI with `uv run fastapi dev src/main.py`
- In the Frontend: start Svelte in development mode with `npm run dev`
